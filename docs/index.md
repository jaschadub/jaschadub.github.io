# Welcome

I'm a technologist with over 25 years of experience building secure, scalable systems at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and cloud infrastructure. Currently focused on developing next-generation AI security solutions.

## Current Work

I'm building the future of AI security at [ThirdKey](https://thirdkey.ai), where we're creating next-generation AI systems for enterprise security and automation. Our research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, cryptography, and defensive security.

### Active Projects

**[Symbiont](https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbiont)**
An AI-native, privacy-first programming language and agent framework for autonomous, policy-aware software development.

**[SchemaPin](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/SchemaPin)**
A cryptographic protocol that ensures tool schema integrity for AI agents, preventing "MCP Rug Pull" attacks by enabling developers to sign schemas and clients to verify them.

**[MockLoop](https://github.com/MockLoop)**
The first AI-native API testing platform using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Automatically generates, executes, and analyzes intelligent test scenarios.

## Security Research

My recent work focuses on AI system security, exploring both offensive and defensive perspectives:

**[AgentNull](https://github.com/jaschadub/AgentNull)**
A comprehensive AI System Security Threat Catalog with proof-of-concepts demonstrating security considerations for Agents, MCP, and RAG systems.

**[VectorSmuggle](https://github.com/jaschadub/VectorSmuggle)**
Research into covert channels using vector embeddings, demonstrating data exfiltration techniques within legitimate RAG operations to help security teams build better defenses.

**[HarmonyDagger](https://github.com/jaschadub/harmonydagger)**
A security-focused system including CLI, API, and deployment tooling.

## Professional Background
