# About

## Background

With over 25 years of experience in technology, I've built my career at the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and software development. I'm passionate about creating secure, scalable systems and contributing to open source software projects that advance the field.

## Current Focus

At [ThirdKey](https://thirdkey.ai), I'm leading research and development of next-generation AI security solutions. Our work focuses on:

- Building secure AI agent frameworks and protocols
- Researching AI system vulnerabilities and defenses
- Developing cryptographic solutions for AI integrity
- Creating tools for AI-native security testing

My approach combines offensive security research with defensive solutions, helping organizations understand and mitigate emerging AI security risks.
